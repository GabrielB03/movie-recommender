# Movie Recommender

This Python project implements a movie recommender system based on collaborative filtering. It suggests movies to users based on their past preferences and similarities with other users.

Features:

User-based Collaborative Filtering: The system analyzes user ratings to find similar users and recommends movies liked by those similar users.

Movie Database Integration: Utilizes a movie database to fetch movie information such as title, genre, and release year.

Rating Prediction: Predicts ratings for movies that users haven't watched yet, using collaborative filtering techniques.

Personalized Recommendations: Recommends movies tailored to individual user tastes, improving over time as more data is collected.

Simple Command-Line Interface (CLI): Provides an easy-to-use CLI for users to interact with the recommender system.

Efficient Algorithms: Employs optimized algorithms to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring fast recommendation generation.

Scalability: Designed to scale with increasing user and movie data, maintaining performance and accuracy.
